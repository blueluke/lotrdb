# The Rivendell Councilroom

A simple deck builder for the Lord of the Rings Living Card Game by Fantasy Flight Games.  

## [Live version](http://blueluke.github.io/lotrdb)


This is a fork of [dddirk's original (now unmaintained) deckbuilder](https://github.com/ddddirk/lotrdb) with a focus on mobile useability.  
It's a single-page application built on Angular.js and Bootstrap.

## Features
* Mobile-friendly single page interface.
* Offline capabilities: You don't need a permanent internet connection to build your decks.
* Card preview with card images or just text.
* Card search with filters for card type, sphere, traits and adventure packs.
* Card suggestions and category filters (Card Draw, Attack Bonus, ...) to help with deck building.
* Download, upload and export decks:
  * Save decks in your local browser storage.
  * OCTGN format support!
  * Exports to Markdown (reddit) and BBCode.
* Simple deck statistics (card type and sphere distribution, sample draws).

The Rivendell Councilroom does not have a deck database or other community features.  
You can try the great [Love of Tales](seastan.github.io) or [ringsDB](ringsdb.com) instead if you need additional features.

## Running your own copy

You need a simple (local) webserver like PHP built-in webserver or python's SimpleHTTPServer.  
Or just fork this repo and use Github's [Pages service](https://pages.github.com/).

## Feedback and Development
